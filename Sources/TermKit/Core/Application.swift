/**
 * The `Application` class is responsible for running your application.
 *
 * The `Application` class has at least one `TopLevel` view that is displayed (and
 * is the one pointed to by `top`) and will send events to this instance.   You
 * should add your views to this top instance.   A minimal initialization sequence
 * looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * Application.prepare ()
 * let win = Window()
 * win.fill ()
 * Application.top.addSubview (win)
 * Application.run()
 * ```
 *
 * The call to the `prepare` method initializes the default console driver, which will
 * be set depending on your platform and heuristics (currently it is limited to the
 * curses version).
 *
 * Then you need to add one or more views to your application, in the example above,
 * a new `Window` is created, we flag it to take over all the available space by calling
 * the `fill` method, and then we add this to the `top` element.   Once this happens,
 * we call `Application.run` which is a method that will never return.
 *
 * # TopLevels
 * At any given point there is only a single `Toplevel` instance active, this means that
 * all mouse and keyboard events are routed here.   There might be multiple visible `Toplevel`
 * at any given point, for example the main application is a `Toplevel`, and a popup dialog
 * box is another form of a toplevel.   When the popup is executing, all keyboard and mouse
 * input are routed to the dialog box, but the main Toplevel will still be updated visually
 * and might also be updated continously.
 *
 * To execute a new nested toplevel, one that either obscures a portion of the screen, or the
 * whole screen, you call the `run` method with the new instance.   To pop the toplevel from
 * the stack, you call the `Application.requestStop` method which will queue the toplevel for
 * termination and will make the previous toplevel the active one.
 *
 * # Main Loop Execution
 * Calling the `run` method in `Application` will start the mainloop, which is implemented using
 * the Dispatch framework.   This means that this method will never return, but also that all
 * the operations that you have come to expect from using the Dispatch API (from Grand Central Dispatch)
 * will work as expected.
 *
 * The TermKit framework is not multi-thread safe, so any operations that you execute on the background
 * should queue operations that access properties, or call methods in any of the TermKit methods
 * using the global queue, so that the operation is executed in the context of the TermKit queue.
 *
